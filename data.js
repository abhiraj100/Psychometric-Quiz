    title: "The Townhall Clap",
    description: `The applause echoed in the atrium. The director was calling out teams that had “moved the needle.”

A few rows from the front, Nikhil stood, buttoned his jacket, and walked to the front when his name was called. He shook hands, glanced once at the crowd, and walked back, straightening the crease in his sleeve before sitting down.

Three rows behind, Tanya clapped too — once, then slower. She didn’t look up. The printout of Slide 16 was still folded in her bag from last night’s review. When the last name was announced, she reached for her bag.

On the mezzanine, Jeevan watched from behind the glass with a samosa in one hand and a Coke in the other. His laptop was open to a paused YouTube video. He smirked, took a bite, and tapped something into his phone. He stayed until the muffins ran out.`,

    description: `The email subject line said: “Company Update: Strategic Realignment.” Everyone knew what that meant.

The floor was quieter than usual. Even the ones who never wore headphones now had them in — music not playing, just buffering silence.

Vikram walked in with his usual coffee and a printed agenda for the stand-up. “Until we
hear otherwise, we stay focused,” he said, placing the agenda neatly next to the whiteboard.

Two seats down, Kabir was refreshing Slack threads like they were air. His browser had
three tabs open: LinkedIn, Naukri, and the HR policy handbook. When asked if he was okay, he nodded — but didn’t look up.

In the far corner, Sana was drafting a long message to her skip-level manager. Not to ask
about her own job — but to question how decisions were being made. She re-read it twice. Then deleted the second half.`,

    title: "The Cross-Team Conflict",
    description: `The design team and the product team were fighting again. Or as the director liked to call it — “collaborative misalignment.”

There had been three conflicting Slack threads, two rescheduled meetings, and one mysteriously deleted comment on a shared doc.

Priya was on both threads, using different tones. In design chat, she added a “totally get it ” to a rant about unrealistic deadlines. In product chat, she replied with “makes sense — will align with the team.” Neither message mentioned her actual opinion. She muted both channels after posting.

Anuj hadn’t said much, but forwarded a screenshot of the doc argument to a director with the note: “Might want to get ahead of this.” Later, he swung by the design bay with a box of brownies and said, “Can we reset vibes before it spirals?”

Naveen, the actual project lead, quietly created a new Jira ticket titled “Team Sync: Clarify Alignment.” He tagged a few team members, added a checklist with items like “review dependencies” and “capture blockers,” marked it as high priority, and assigned it to 
“Team – All.” Then he turned to working on his slides for next week’s leadership update.

    title: "The Appraisal Puzzle",
    description: `The meeting room had one window and no signal. Appraisal season.

Rajat came in with a binder — printed KPIs, last quarter’s OKRs, a tabbed section for “growth highlights.” When his manager suggested a mid-year target tweak, Rajat nodded instantly. “Absolutely. Whatever you think makes sense,” he said, already adjusting his sheet.

Meera brought her appraisal sheet, unmarked. When asked about her goals, she said, “They’re fine.” About the team: “It’s okay.” She paused before each answer — like she was trying to remember who wrote them six months ago. Before leaving: “Do I need to sign anything?” Then softer, almost automatic: “Thanks for the time.”

Fatima had her own notes. Metrics. Peer quotes. When the manager said, “There’s a perception that you’re not always aligned,” she paused. Then asked, “Do you mean aligned with the org… or with you?” She didn’t wait for the full answer before thanking him and walking out.

Rhea stared at the Excel cell for a while before saying, “This isn’t what we agreed on.” Silence. Then: “Do you want me to do it, or will someone else?”
No one responded. She clicked 'Save' and walked out for coffee.

Sahil said nothing. He added a comment in the doc — “Need clarity on this input source” — and then muted the thread. Later that night, he removed his name from the author list.

Nitin smoothed his shirt, nodded, and said, “Let’s be pragmatic.” He copied the older baseline, adjusted a few figures, and added a footnote that said “Based on revised inputs.” Then asked the group chat if someone could take over slide design.

Varun reacted with a and a “Cool, will review by EOD.” By 6pm, he’d renamed the deck Final_Varun_Edits.pptx, cut three “low-impact” slides, added his own intro, and forwarded it to the director with a “Just streamlined a bit. Let me know if this works.”

Lata didn’t blink. She updated the handover doc with bullet points, links, screenshots, even jokes in the comments. Then she deleted the line that said “original framework by Lata (April).” At 9:14pm, she messaged: “Let me know if you need anything else :)” The smiley had been retyped three times.

Om had built half the backend. He left one comment: “Check logic on slide 14.” Didn’t join
the prep call. Logged off at 7:23pm. Next morning, he filled out the internal transfer form
and added “reasons not urgent.”

    description: `Niyati had been shaping the client solution for weeks. She led the brainstorm, named the folder, wrote the first draft. At lunch she said, “Honestly, this project feels like my baby.” The word hung in the air. No one disagreed.

Then the client changed scope. The manager pinged: “Let’s bring in Zubin to add fresh eyes.” Zubin was polite. He commented sparingly, then added a slide with “Possible alternate flow” in bold. When Niyati saw it, she replied: “Let’s keep things focused. We’re already aligned on structure.”

Sana had been quiet for most of the week. Not uninvolved — just everywhere in the
background. She was the one answering client follow-ups. Cleaning up the formatting. Creating backups of each deck version — “just in case.”

When Zubin’s slide appeared and Niyati pushed back, Sana didn’t pick a side. She DM’d them both: “Want me to stitch together a hybrid version? Totally okay either way.” No one replied.

At 10:36 PM, she started merging the slides anyway. Changed colors to match. Removed names from the title. At 12:07 AM, she uploaded it as “Final_v5_Sync.” No comments. Just a emoji from the manager the next morning.
